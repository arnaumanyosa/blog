So yes, another blog on Internet. And yes, about UI/UX Design and Web development! Yazz! What we really needed!

Joking apart, this blog starts together with my new [portfolio](https://arnau.me) so you can understand what I spent my time working on and my thoughts about Digital products, Internet, Technology and other related subjects may appear in the future.

Hope you enjoy the content!
